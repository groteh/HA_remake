        <li>Know major artists, artwork & styles (art ID on test)</li>
        <li>Focuses on reality (look to self for improving lot in life, not G-d) rather than morality of Middle Ages (look to priests & G-d for moral guidance, focus on christian religion)</li>
        <li>Revives classical (Greek & Roman) learning - promotes reason and experience as guides for beliefs, not religious faith</li>
        <li>Focuses on humans - the body is beautiful</li>

      <h5>Machiavelli</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Wrote <i>The Prince</i></li>
        <li>Excerpt focuses on a Prince's finances & qualities of leadership</li>
        <li>"Liberality" = generosity</li>
        <li>"Niggardliness" = cheapness, miserliness</li>
        <li>Good idea to go through vocab first, then read excerpt, then answer questions & hand in for credit</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that Machiavelli focuses on a Renaissance prince's need for practicality - he must appear to be free with money, yet save for a rainy day; he must be ready to change alliances for the betterment of his people; the people must be controlled, yet kept happy and riot free.</li>
