    <h5>Ms. Fine's Mission</h5>
    <p id="MissionStatement">As an educator, I would like all of my students to feel that they have learned from my class, whether it be subject-oriented or life-oriented.  I will provide an environment in which students can learn life skills and pursue their own individual paths.  I will foster an atmosphere that embraces technology as a tool and appropriate use of that technology.  I will communicate effectively with parents so they can reinforce and support student learning and skills at home. Students and parents will be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. </p>

    <p>On May 21, 2013 we were lucky enough to have Ms. Claudia Erlich Sobral screen her powerful documentary Ghosts of the Third Reich for our students. If you would like more information about her film, go to <a href=http://www.sdcinematografica.com/index.php?code=progetti_pagina_5_540>http://www.sdcinematografica.com/index.php?code=progetti_pagina_5_540</a> or to the Facebook page www.facebook.com/TheGhostsOfTheThirdReich.</p>
    <h5>Want to help out?</h5>
    <p>Is there something missing from the classroom?</p>
    <p>Donate to PTSA! Last year PTSA provided teachers with multimedia carts, LCD projectors, ELMO document cameras, and laptops, as well as supplementary materials and opportunities for professional development.</p>
    <p>Parents and students may also donate directly to the classroom for a tax-deductible donation. Gift cards for Amazon.com, Office Depot, OfficeMax and Staples are always useful in any amount for subsidizing classroom supplies.</p>
    <p>Thank you for all of your care and generosity!</p>
    <h5>Homework Hints:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Create flashcards for vocabulary and important terms</li>
      <li>Study in a quite place where you won't be disturbed</li>
      <li>Outline or take notes on all reading assignments</li>
      <li>Tape record lectures and discussions for easy review</li>
      <li>Keep a binder at home with all of the chapters organized for easy review at the semester final</li>
      <li>Utilize online publisher web sites and activities for more review and practice</li>
      <li>Assemble a small study group to review for tests</li>
